# Nash Games to Game of Life Neighborhoods
## NECSI Winter Course Project
Applying Nash game code for prisoners' dilemma and stag hunt using an agent based model in a grid. 

## To Run the code 
**simple setup** install [anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/download/) and try running **stag_hunt_context.py**

You should see grid populated with stags, rabbits, and foxes. The foxes then play a nash game to determine if the cooperate to hunt stag or defect to hunt rabbit(s), along with a color coded grid and a digraph of the gameboard.

In a classic, pure nash game points are awarded every round. In this contextual version the spareness of the grid allows a commensal state to emerge where two agents cannot play due to a lack of dependencies in their environment.
